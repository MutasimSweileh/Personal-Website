It`s the biggest website I have been working on; It is a software as a service for fine-dining restaurants in many countries. The project come to me with old code built in 2015 with laravel 4.0, I rebuilt it and fix all the functions it took 8 months to rebuild and optimize. I gained a lot of experience from this project it was amazing I love fixing things.
